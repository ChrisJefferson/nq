\Chapter{The Nilpotent Quotient Package}

This chapter describes the Interface to the ANU Nilpotent Quotient
Program.  Some functions rely on the functionality of the `polycyclic'
package and cannot be used if this package is not installed.

For easy reference, define the lowere central sreis of a group $G$ by
$G_1 = G$ and $G_{i+1} = [G,G_i]$ for $i \geq 1.$

\Section{The main functions}

The following functions are available and require the presence of the
`polycyclic' package.

\>NilpotentQuotient( <fp group>, <class> )

\>NilpotentQuotient( <output filename>, <fp group>, <class> )

\>NilpotentQuotient( <input filename>, <class> )

\>NilpotentQuotient( <output filename>, <input filename>, <class> )

This function computes a polycyclic presentation for $G/G_{c+1}$ where
$G$ is  the finitely presented group  <fp group> and $c$  is the class
specified  by the parameter  <class>.  In  other words,  this function
returns the largest nilpotent quotient of the finitely presented group
<fp group> of class at most <class>.

\>EpimorphismNilpotentQuotient( <fp group>, <class> )

This function computes an epimorphism onto $G/G_{c+1}.$  It requires the
presence of the `polycyclic' package.

\>LowerCentralFactors( <fp group>, <class> )

This function computes the abelian invariants of the factors of the lower
central series of the given finitely presented group up to nilpotency
class <class>.
