  <Heading>Installation of the Package</Heading> 

  Installation of the package requires the GNU multiple precision
  library (GNU MP <Cite Key="GNUMP"/>).  If this library is not
  available on your system, it has to be installed first.  A copy of
  GNU MP can be obtained from <URL>http://gmplib.org/</URL>.

  Installation of the ANU NQ is done in two steps.  First the
  configure script is run:
  <Listing Type="Installation"> ./configure  </Listing>
  Among other things it will tell you whether it succeeded in locating
  the GNU MP library and the corresponding include files. If it tells
  you that it could not find the GNU MP include files or the GNU MP
  libraries, you have to run configure with additional parameters. For
  example, if you have installed GNU MP yourself in your home directory,
  you would type something like the following
  <Listing Type="Installation"> ./configure --with-gmp=/home/me/gmp </Listing>
  If configure reports no problems, the next step is to start the
  compilation:
  <Listing Type="Installation"> make </Listing>

  <P/> A compiled version of the program named `nq' is then placed
  into the directory `bin/&tlt;complicated name&tgt;'.  The
  &tlt;complicated name&tgt; component encodes the operating system
  and the compiler used.  This allows you to compile NQ on several
  architectures sharing the same files system.

  <P/>
  If there are any warnings or even fatal error messages during the
  compilation process, please send a copy to the address at the end of
  this document together with information about your operating system,
  the compiler you used and any changes you might have made to the
  source code.  We will have a look at your problems and try to fix
  them.
 
  <P/> After the compilation is finished you can check if the ANU NQ
  is running properly on your system.  Simply type

  <Listing Type="Installation"> make test </Listing>
  
  This runs some computations and compares their output with the output
  files in the directory `examples'. If any errors are reported, please
  follow the instruction that are printed out.

  <P/>The installation is completed by compiling the manual of the
  package.  This is done from within &GAP;.
