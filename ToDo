This is a list of tasks which need to be done before nq is released as
a GAP 4 share library package.

-- NilpotentQuotient() should return a quotient system.
-- Update the test files and testNq.
-- Add more GAP documentation.
-- Add access to the Engel options.
-- If configure cannot find certain components, then one should run
   configure again and not make with the correct options.  This way,
   configure can remember the correct values and it will suffice make.
-- Update installation procedure

-- GAP-Funktionalit"at davon abh"angig machen, on
   RequirePackage("polycyc") erfolgreich ist.
