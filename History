   Dec 1992: Version 1.0 of the ANU NQ

22 Jan 1993: Version 1.1 of the ANU NQ
	   + introduction of this file and the file README
	   + added option -t to nq
	   + improvements to testNq
	   + added target clean to the make file
26 Feb 1993: Version 1.1b
	   + added the option -a to nq and the corresponding
	     output routine outputMatrix() to glimt.c.
22 Jun 1993: 
           + The file README has not yet been updated with a
             description of the option -a. 
12 Aug 1993: Version 1.1c
           + modified the file engel.c to allow checking of more
             identities. This entry has been made in Oct 93; it
             has to be checked what the modifications are and which
             options have been added.
14 Oct 1993:
           + changed the functions buildPairs() and buildWord()
             such that they also build words with negative exponents.
             This can be switched off using the option -s (s for
             semigroup words).
           + Added a check for the identity matrix to the function 
             addRow(). A flag EarlyStop is set if the check is
             positive. This flag is now used in the files
             consistency.c, relations.c and engel.c to stop the
             computation as soon as all new generators are eliminated.
           + Fixed the last printing of the total runtime in main().

Maerz 1994:
           + Version 1.1d
           + changed the function evalEngel() in engel.c such that it
             stops checking instances of the Engel law as soon as all
             instances of a certain weight did not yield anything new.
             This is not proved to be mathematically sound.
           + the function buildPairs() in engel.c now checks if an
             instance [x, ny] of the n-th Engel law is trivial for
             weight reasons.
           + the function Collect() in collect.c aborts a run if it
             runs into an integer overflow.
           + the functions outputMatrix() and printGapMatrix() in
             glimt.c have been changed to print only rows and columns
             whose pivot entry is not 1.
           + the function MatrixToExpVec() in glimt.c now frees the
             large matrix row by row.
           + Update the README file.

04 Aug 1994:
           + Version 1.1e
           + fixed printing of preimages in PrintEpim() in relation.c.
           + the error function of Collect() now prints the generator
             which caused the error. Collect() was also slightly
             reformatted.
30 Mar 1995:
           + added option that allows to check the Engel condition in
             reverse order

 2 Jul 1995:
           + added -m option that outputs all non-zero vectors handed
             to addRow() to file.

25 Aug 1995:
           + built integer overflow check into function Number() in
             presentation.c .

22 Nov 1995:
           + replaced the function Commutator() in collect.c.  Instead
             of using Solve to solve uv x = vu the equation is solved
             directly. 

27 June 1996:
           + while MFN was visiting the Magnus group in New York they
             indicated interest in using this code.  Dmitry Bormotov (their
             chief programmer) got in contact with me and today I made a copy
             of the this version of the code available to him via anonymous
             ftp on gregory.dcs.st-and.ac.uk:pub/werner 

Oct 1996:
           + Added support for metabelian identities.

Sep 1997:
           + Added the option -p to toggle the printing of the epimorphism
             and the nilpotent quotient at the end of a run.  I also added
             code to print the definitions of each generator of weight at
             least 2.

Jan 1998:
           + print statements for the definitions of new generators.
           + added option -E to reverse the order in which Engel
             generators are processes.
